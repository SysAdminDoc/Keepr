# Keepr Roadmap

> Single source of truth for outstanding work. Completed items move to [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md). Long-form rationale lives in [RESEARCH_FEATURE_PLAN_v0.5.md](RESEARCH_FEATURE_PLAN_v0.5.md). The original [RESEARCH_FEATURE_PLAN.md](RESEARCH_FEATURE_PLAN.md) is kept as historical reference for the v0.1 → v0.2 transition.

Priority legend: **P0** = data loss / crash / security · **P1** = visible bug / high user value · **P2** = polish / nice-to-have · **P3** = future / experimental.

## Resolved open questions

- **Code-signing strategy** — unsigned for now. README will document the SmartScreen workaround. Revisit when distribution scale justifies a cert.

See [RESEARCH_FEATURE_PLAN_v0.5.md "Open Questions"](RESEARCH_FEATURE_PLAN_v0.5.md#open-questions) for the remaining undecided defaults.
